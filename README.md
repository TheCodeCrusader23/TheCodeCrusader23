### Exploring the Intersection of Data Science, Innovation, and Problem Solving.

   

### ⚡️ The Fast Facts: My Mission & Approach

I'm a Data Scientist in the making, driven by the philosophy of **'smart grind > blind hustle'**

My journey began with a **B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering**, and I'm currently expanding my horizons by pursuing a **BSc in Data Science from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IIT Madras)**. This dual academic foundation equips me with a robust understanding of both core computer science principles and specialized data methodologies.

   

### 🧠 My Skill Stack & Current Learning

I believe in continuous growth and a diverse toolkit.

* **Languages & Tools:** Python (my go to for data!), MySQL, pandas, matplotlib, Git, C++, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook
* **Currently Deepening My Skills In:**
    * Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in C++
    * Core Statistics for robust analysis
    * Advanced Machine Learning concepts
