# Hi there, I'm Parth Singh 👋 | The Data Storyteller 🚀

### Exploring the Intersection of Data Science, Innovation, and Problem Solving.

   

### ⚡️ The Fast Facts: My Mission & Approach

I'm a Data Scientist in the making, driven by the philosophy of **'smart grind > blind hustle'**. My ultimate mission is to become a top tier Data Scientist in the USA, leveraging data to build impactful solutions and uncover compelling narratives.

My journey began with a **B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering**, and I'm currently expanding my horizons by pursuing a **BSc in Data Science from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IIT Madras)**. This dual academic foundation equips me with a robust understanding of both core computer science principles and specialized data methodologies.

   

### 🧠 My Skill Stack & Current Learning

I believe in continuous growth and a diverse toolkit.

* **Languages & Tools:** Python (my go to for data!), MySQL, pandas, matplotlib, Git, C++, VS Code
* **Strong Suits:** A keen eye for **Mathematics**, powerful **Data Visualization**, and a solid foundation in **Computational Thinking**.
* **Currently Deepening My Skills In:**
    * Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in C++
    * Core Statistics for robust analysis
    * Advanced Machine Learning concepts

I'm committed to practical learning, having completed extensive programs like CodeWithHarry's job ready Data Science course, and I'm always looking for new challenges.
